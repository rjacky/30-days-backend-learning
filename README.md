# 30-days-backend-learning
This repository contains my notes and exercises for learning Backend Development over 30 days.
Every day I'll write down the topic, discussion, practice, and notes into the hari-XX folder.

# Goal
- Consistently study backend development for at least 1 topic daily.
- Create mini-projects (CRUD, Auth, simple API).
- Document the learning process as a portfolio.

# Progress 1 / 30 Days
